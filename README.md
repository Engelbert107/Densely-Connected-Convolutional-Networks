# Densely Connected Convolutional Networks


DenseNets with L layers has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. They address this shortcoming by reducing the size of the modules and by introducing more connections between layers. In fact, the output of each layer flows directly as input to all subsequent layers of the same feature dimension as illustrated in their Figure 1. This increases the dependency between the layers and thus reduces redundancy.
